File: Learn JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners
--------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction:
----------------

This is the beginner's JavaScript course you are looking for.

My name is Bo Carnes and I'm with freecodecamp.org. 

In this full JavaScript course you will learn everything you need to know to get started with JavaScript.

This course is perfect for beginners or anyone that just wants a refresher on basic JavaScript syntax.

This course actually goes along with the freeCodeCamp.org JavaScript curriculum.

So, if you want some live coding challenges to go along with every part of this course you can check the link in the description to that curriculum.

But, this is a completely standalone video.

So you don't need to go through freeCodeCamp.org but it could be helpful.

Also after this course you're going to want to complete some or build some JavaScript projects.

So I have a link in the description to some project tutorials.

But then after event you're going to want to create some project on your own.

That's how you really learn JavaScript.

You have to create things without even going through the tutorial and just use a search engine to find the things that you don't know or need to learn.

To go along with the FreeCodeCamp curriculum I have all the es6 stuff in the second part of this course and that's pretty much it.

Let's learn some JavaScript.
