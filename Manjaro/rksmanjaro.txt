This actually worked:

0. Started the httpd and mysql service

1. I created a directory inside the srv/http

sudo mkdir projectname

2. I gave the access to all users.

sudo chmod 777 -R projectname

3. Added that folder as a virtual host in this file:

sudo subl /etc/httpd/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf


This was the content:
<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerName projectname.kamal

DocumentRoot "/srv/http/projectname"

    <Directory "/srv/http/projectname">
        # use mod_rewrite for pretty URL support
        RewriteEngine on
        # If a directory or a file exists, use the request directly
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        # Otherwise forward the request to index.php
        RewriteRule . index.php
        # use index.php as index file
        DirectoryIndex index.php
        # ...other settings...
        # Apache 2.4
        Require all granted

        ## Apache 2.2
        # Order allow,deny
        # Allow from all
    </Directory>

</VirtualHost>

4. Added this to the /etc/hosts

127.0.1.1  projectname.kamal

5. Restarted the httpd service:

sudo systemctl restart httpd

6. Cloned the github repo to a different folder in Dekstop.

7. Moved its content into /srv/http/portfolio

8. php init

9. composer update

10. Changed the dbname and password in common/config/main-local.php

11. php yii migrate
